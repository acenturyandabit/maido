We are looking for a sponsor to help support our stage 2 prototype of our installation, the \\\"Antigravity chamber\\\", which will provide a strong opportunity to outreach to a university group and has great potential for advertising at VIVID Sydney, one of the most viewed exhibitions in Sydney each year.\\n\\nOur team consists of a diverse group of 10 members including 7 men and 3 women, studying subjects from Electrical and Mechatronic engineering to Design and Architecture. Although among us we have realised many practical robotics projects including a self-driving boat and a skittle sorter, most of our team members are only in our second year of university, which would make us the youngest group of engineer-artists to have attempted a VIVID submission. We believe that with the right support we can inspire our fellow university students to strive to achieve greatness.\\n\\nFor this project we are hoping for two main pieces of support: a sponsorship to provide us with up to $10,000 worth of funding for purchasing the materials and acquiring the expertise to build our round 2 prototype, and consulting assistance in project management, civil engineering, design or any other relevant knowledge areas you are willing to help with. We are more than happy to negotiate design concepts such as energy conservation, the water cycle, STEM and a sense of technlogy and wonder as the focus of our design, and integrate any marketing elements you desire.\\n\\nAs far, the project team made a submission to VIVID 2019 which earned us an interview; there they asked us to produce a prototype and implied they would support us for 2020 if we were able to do so. We are currently attempting to assemble our first prototype which we aim to display around the city as a proof of concept. Once this is complete we will be more than willing to provide supporting evidence and media.\\n\\nWe aim to finish the first prototype by April 2019; and if all goes to plan would like to secure a sponsorship with your company as mentioned above by June 2019. We will then display our second prototype in September 2019; and present this as supporting evidence to the VIVID selection committee in November 2019, then create a full scale project for VIVID 2020; and at each stage we will ensure that your marketing and outreach goals are given a strong priority in our work.\\n\\nAside from the advertising potential, we hope that through partnering with you we can open a line of communication between your company and a cohort of ambitious and talented engineers from the University of Sydney. I hope that this project sounds appealing to you; and kindly request that you reply as soon as possible with your thoughts on working with us.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nSteven Liu (on behalf of the USYD VIVID 2019 team).\\n\\n\\n\\n-----\\nhey thx looks good ttyl\\n\\n-----\\nbyg sad cri\\n\\n\"}},\"fa6l\":{\"name\":\"+2 days\",\"tags\":\"#marker\",\"date\":\"auto +1d 24:00\",\"description\":{\"text\":\"\"}},\"y44h\":{\"name\":\"ESC460 (capstone)\",\"tags\":\"\",\"date\":\" 8:00 thursday&8:00am tuesday \",\"description\":{\"text\":\"\"}},\"769c\":{\"name\":\"remind J about matrix\",\"tags\":\"\",\"date\":\"10/1\",\"description\":{\"text\":\"\"}},\"2phv\":{\"name\":\"ENGR 407 (entrepreneurship)\",\"tags\":\"\",\"date\":\" 10:30 thurs&10:30 am tues\",\"description\":{\"text\":\"\"}},\"ao1h\":{\"name\":\"ENGR408 (leadership)\",\"tags\":\"\",\"date\":\"4:30 thurs&4:30 tues\",\"description\":{\"text\":\"Leadership principles\"}},\"02o6\":{\"name\":\"ENGR409\",\"tags\":\"\",\"date\":\"6:00pm thursday\",\"description\":{\"text\":\"\"}},\"6k3l\":{\"name\":\"tomorrowmarker\",\"tags\":\"#marker\",\"date\":\"auto +2d 24:00pm\",\"description\":{\"text\":\"[object Object]\"}},\"aem6\":{\"name\":\"US trip planning\",\"tags\":\"#morning\",\"date\":\"+3d\",\"description\":{\"text\":\"-------------\\nTODO\\n-------------\\n- Prepare for class\\n- check buses for return\\n-------------\\nIN NY\\n-------------\\n- Get hot drynk\\neh idk shop around. budget $10. \\n------------\\nBUDGET: best case\\n------------\\nAccomodation: $1k\\nFood: $10 p/d = $300\\nPublic transportation: $5 p/d = $150\\nLaundry: $10 pw = $40\\nBuses for return: $100\\n--- total: $1590 = $2400\\n------------\\nBudget: Worst case\\n------------\\nAccomodation: $2400\\nFood: $30 p/d: $900\\nTransport: $20 p/d = $600 \\nBuses for return: $150\\n--- total: $4070 = $5800 AUD. shit. \\nexchange rate: holy flippin burgers.\\n\\n-------------\\nUPENN AIMS\\n-------------\\n- Make sure you can live and take care of yourself.\\n-- Cook for yourself and your friends\\n-- Wash your own laundry.\\n-- NO UNPRODUCTIVITIES EVER.\\n\\n-------------\\nNEW YORK THINGS TO DO\\n-------------\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_R._Guggenheim_Museum\\nSTATUE OF LIBERTY\\nBROADWAY - Musical?
