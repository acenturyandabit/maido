Say you had 50 options and you needed to select a number of them; instead of comparing all of them, you may only need to compare 5 pairs of options. The comparisons don't even have to be particularly quantitative; they can simply be \"I prefer A over B\". \n>> The algorithm then takes these comparisons and looks at the quantitative value given for each factor for each option, and determines a weighting, such that the order that the user determined is preserved.\n>>Then the algorithm calculates a final score for each option based on each factor.\n>>Then the algorithm displays the available options to the user, ordered by score. \n- If the user looks at the list and sees some things are out of order, they can reorder the list; and the computer will pick up these changes and update the list, until the optimal ordering is achieved.\n\n\n... ok so this is rather an extended version of what I actually did.
