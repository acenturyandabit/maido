            <p>One or two levels of chat threads just simply arent enough for life when you need to get work done, fun done, and everything in between. So at hyperthreader, we'll give you <em>as many subthread levels you need.</em></p>

            <p>Is your friend/coworker/little brother going completely off topic in your thread? No bigge! With <em>super flexible thread rearranging</em> you can stay on track, without interrupting anyone's flow.</p>
